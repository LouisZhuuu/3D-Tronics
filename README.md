# 3D-Tronics
presented by Eunoia Junior College robotics

We aim to create a device using micro:bit to help those with:

PHYSICAL DISABILITY
“A limitation on a person’s physical functioning, mobility,
dexterity or stamina.”

UPPER BODY WEAKNESSES

Caused by congenital conditions or acquired due to
serious injury, or muscle weakness due to old age.

Sufferers face difficulty carrying their stuff with their
hands, thus they turn to solutions such as using a
pushcart or having a helper on hand.

INTENDED OUTCOME of our device:

Following the user, including on slopes

Carry a few kilogrammes of load

Will alleviate some physical burden on those with upper
body weakness

Some of the features of our device:

micro:bit can be kept in pocket

Alleviate the burden for people with upper-body
weaknesses to carry out their daily activities

Doing so by removing the responsibility of them carrying
their own stuff, which most of them cannot, and thus
gives them more independence
